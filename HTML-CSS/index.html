<!-- Web semantic elements in HTML refer to html tags
    that take on the name of their intended purpose within
    the document. Examples of semantic html tags would include
    <header>, <table>, <nav>, and <section> (among others).

    The goal and purpose of semantic web elements are to have the
    developer and the browser on the same page regarding
    the functionality of the contents of the element.
    With this, HTML is able to add more specified features to the
    semantic elements. For example, a <table> already knows 
    about the nature of the info you are displaying, and can 
    have a default styling already in place - leading to faster
    table-building.

    Custom semantic tags are when the developer can come up 
    with their own word to be the 'tag' name for what would otherwise
    be a div.

    A few good practices would include familiarizing yourself with
    any documentation on the style and function of any semantic
    element you wish to use. The <table> tag has it's own style and
    way of being displayed, and if you don't play by its rules, 
    it may be difficult. The same thing goes with <video> and <audio>
    tags - without adding an 'autoplay' attribute, they will not play
    automatically as you might think they would. 

    When creating custom semantics, it's good to use a word or term
    related to the function of the contents.
